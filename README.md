#Mint your Dog!
Welcome to "Mint your Dog!" 
- a Flow Hackathon project built using Flow Blockchain and React JS. This project allows you to mint your very own unique dog NFT on the Flow Blockchain.

###Overview In this project,
we used React JS as the frontend framework and Flow Blockchain to mint the unique dog NFT. Each NFT has a unique ID, name, image, and other attributes, making it one-of-a-kind. Getting Started To run this project on your local machine, you'll need to follow these steps:

###Clone the repository:
git clone (https://github.com/jigarvyasidea/flow_Hackathone)
Navigate to the project directory: cd mint-your-dog Install the dependencies: npm install Usage To run the project, follow these steps:

#Start the Flow emulator:
flow emulator start Deploy the smart contract: flow project deploy Start the server: npm start Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 Once you're on the app, you'll be able to select different attributes for your dog, including its breed, color, and accessories. After selecting the attributes, you'll be able to mint your own unique dog NFT!

#Contributing

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
