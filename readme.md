###Mint your Dog!
Welcome to "Mint your Dog!" - a Flow Hackathon project built using Flow Blockchain and React JS. This project allows you to mint your very own unique dog NFT on the Flow Blockchain.

###Overview
In this project, we used React JS as the frontend framework and Flow Blockchain to mint the unique dog NFT. Each NFT has a unique ID, name, image, and other attributes, making it one-of-a-kind.
